  "The governor contract as executable tests -- this vertical's own
  scope boundary ('does NOT control assembly/test-bench equipment
  directly... does NOT authorize or execute maintenance/equipment
  operations... does NOT self-issue a domestic-appliance safety-
  certification mark') implemented faithfully. The single invariant
  under test:

    DomApplAdvisor never schedules maintenance, flags a safety
    concern, or coordinates a shipment the Domestic Appliance Plant
    Operations Governor would reject;
    `:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/
    `:coordinate-shipment` NEVER auto-commit at any phase;
    `:log-production-batch` (no physical/financial risk) MAY
    auto-commit when clean; and every decision (commit OR hold) leaves
    exactly one ledger fact."
