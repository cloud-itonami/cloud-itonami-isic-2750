(ns domappl.store
  "SSoT for the domestic-appliance plant-operations coordination
  actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a
  rewrite -- the same seam every `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this
  fleet uses.

  Scope note: like its siblings (`cloud-itonami-isic-2640`'s own
  `consumerelec.store`, `cloud-itonami-isic-2710`'s own
  `elecequipmfg.store`), this build ships a single `MemStore` backend
  only (atom of EDN) -- the deterministic default for dev/tests/demo,
  no deps. Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1, this vertical
  is self-contained (no external domestic-appliance-manufacturing
  capability library, no jurisdiction-scoped Datomic-parity
  requirement driving a second backend); a `langchain.db`-backed store
  can be added later behind the same protocol without changing any
  caller.

  Four kinds of entity live here:
    - `batches`          -- the central entity. A production batch's
                             product-type/dielectric-test-kv/quantity/
                             defect-rate record. `:verified?` marks
                             whether the batch's own claims have
                             actually been QC-inspected (never inferred
                             from a routine intake patch);
                             `:registered?` marks whether it is on file
                             in the plant's production ledger;
                             `:shipped-units` tracks the batch's own
                             cumulative-shipped ground truth.
    - `equipment`         -- an assembly/test-bench unit's own record.
                             `:verified?`/`:registered?` track whether
                             it has actually been inspected/
                             commissioned and is on file -- the same
                             ground-truth discipline as `batches`.
    - `maintenance`       -- a scheduled assembly/test-bench
                             maintenance-window DRAFT against a piece
                             of equipment (`domappl.registry`'s
                             `register-maintenance`). Dedicated
                             `:scheduled?` double-schedule guard (never
                             a `:status` value -- the same discipline
                             every prior governor's guards establish,
                             informed by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s
                             status-lifecycle bug, ADR-2607071320).
    - `shipments`         -- a proposed outbound domestic-appliance
                             product shipment DRAFT (`domappl.registry`'s
                             `register-shipment`).

  Plus a generic `records` map (id -> raw record) used only for
  direct, domain-agnostic `commit-record!` calls (a record with no
  `:effect` key) -- the store-level primitive every sibling actor's
  own MemStore exposes underneath its domain-specific commit dispatch.

  The ledger stays append-only: 'which batch was logged, which
  maintenance was scheduled against a verified/registered equipment
  unit, which shipment was coordinated and at what
  independently-recomputed quantity, approved by whom, which safety
  concern was flagged' is always a query over an immutable log -- the
  audit trail a plant owner or downstream buyer trusting this
  coordinator needs."
