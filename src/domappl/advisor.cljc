(ns domappl.advisor
  "DomApplAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for the
  domestic-appliance plant-operations coordination actor.

  It normalizes production-batch patches (product-type/dielectric-
  test-kv/quantity/defect-rate), drafts an assembly/test-bench-
  equipment maintenance scheduling proposal against a piece of
  equipment, drafts a safety-concern flag, and drafts an outbound
  domestic-appliance product shipment coordination proposal against a
  production batch. CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor. It
  returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields it cited), never
  a committed record and NEVER a real assembly/test-bench-equipment
  actuation, freight dispatch, or safety-certification -- see README
  `What this actor does NOT do`. Every output is censored downstream
  by `domappl.governor` before anything touches the SSoT.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):

  CRITICAL invariant this advisor upholds: every request it is asked to
  route MUST itself carry `:effect :propose` (the request-level
  contract every caller of this actor agrees to) -- `domappl.governor`
  HARD-holds any request that doesn't, so a mis-wired caller can never
  reach a commit path even if this advisor were compromised."
